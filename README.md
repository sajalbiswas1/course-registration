# Add at least Projects features.

- Props: Props play a fundamental role in React as they facilitate the transfer of data from a parent component to its child components. They offer a means of customizing and configuring components, resulting in the dynamic rendering of data and behavior within a React application.

- toast: A success message upon a successful form submission or API request. An error message upon a failed API request.A popup notification appears when the user makes a mistake or corrects it.

- Dynamic: React's virtual DOM allows for efficient updates, minimizing the need to re-render the entire UI and improving performance.  React's component-based architecture promotes code reusability, making it easier to maintain and scale applications.
